# The "System Virus" Prank Website

A harmless, browser-based prank designed to simulate a series of system errors and malfunctions, culminating in a humorous "Gotcha!" reveal.

## üöÄ How It Works

The website is a multi-stage prank built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It guides a user through a series of escalating fake errors, from a flickering screen and a terminal window to a fake "Blue Screen of Death" and a final, surprising twist. It is designed to be a completely safe and entertaining experience.
